    - title : "Engagement Packages"
      description: "I adore a good love story; hearing what makes a couple unique and capturing it is one of the best perks of the job. For your engagement session, it is crucial to be authentic to yourselves and to have fun. It’s also a great opportunity to become comfortable in front of a lens before the big day. I will offer light direction but no session is staged – it’s about you, your story as a couple, and the excitement of getting to marry your best friend."
