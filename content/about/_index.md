Oh Hello! I’m Nichole Steffey, creator and photographer of Lock and Shutter Photography. I’m a believer in doing what makes your soul happy, that’s why I started a career in photography. My passion is telling stories, capturing moments that will live forever, and having the freedom to be creative.

I define my photography style as exclusive to showcasing an individual’s beauty and authenticity. Nature is my canvas. I love the great outdoors and the beauty it has to offer – and there’s not a more beautiful canvas than Wild and Wonderful West Virginia.

Although I’m based out of Huntington, WV, I’m always ready for an adventure and am eager to explore.
