## Frequently Asked Questions

You will typically receive your photos 2-3 weeks after session. Don’t worry, I will be in contact with you along the way – perhaps providing some teasers to get you excited!

{{% expand "How do I access my photos?" %}}

Photos will be accessible through Google Photos. Once your session is edited, I’ll create an album on Google Photos and share the album with you. From there, you can download your photos. Please note, any photos that are shared via Instagram must tag Lock and Shutter Photography.

When manageable, weather can add a unique flair to sessions; however, if the weather does not play in our favor we will reschedule for the next convenient time available.

{{% expand "Do you edit the photos?" %}}

Yes! Many photos are taken during a session. After the session, I choose the best raw images and edit them to provide you with high resolution photos.

{{% expand "How far will you travel?" %}}

I’m always willing to go on an adventure! I am willing to travel up to 3 hours- with no extra cost. If it is longer than 3 hours, I will need to charge extra to compensate my travel expenses. Contact me for further information.
